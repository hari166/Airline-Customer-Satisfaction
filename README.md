# Airline-Customer-Satisfaction
Detecting whether a customer will be satisfied or not with the airline

## Abstract
In the aviation industry, which is recuperating quickly after the subset of the Covid-19
pandemic, this will be of great aid to flyers looking to travel. We feel that it will especially be
of great use for first time flyers, future flyers/customers to pick out an airline in order for them
to travel in comfort and convenience. Output consolidated from the data can help us decide to
choose an airline considering the various parameters.
